# Speen Chroma

## THIS REPO IS NOW ARCHIVED
While trying to go back to getting this mod to work on the latest version of the game, I noticed porting was very painful to do as the mod was a little too tightly integrated with old game code that has changed so much, I would have to rewrite half of the loading part. Plus the unpolished aspect of the triggers section and the fact that I'm resuming a lost project and don't want to dive into what kind of atrocious code I might've wrote, I am now archiving this repo and starting fresh once again, this time in a completely separate codebase.

Introducing **Speen Chroma**, a [Spin Rhythm XD](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1058830/Spin_Rhythm_XD/) mod to further customize the wheel and notes' colours.

**This is the mono rewrite branch.** The mod has been remade from scratch since the modding scene switched to Mono.
